# Routes

Routes are our different directories for our webpage. More broadly, our website pages. [index.js](index.js) is our homepage, [opportunities.js](opportunities.js) is one of many endpoints for database data. The behavior for loading these endpoints properly is defined in [../app.js](../app.js).

To be able to properly show or host data, the data needs an endpoint. Think of our data as a pipe filled with water. To be able to fill a cup (access our data), we need a faucet. Our endpoints are those faucets.
